# Leadership Roles

As Hack for LA continues to grow, we’ve recognized the need to have a stable and legitimate team to handle all day-to-day operations. Below, are the list of positions that will govern all Hack for LA operations, including responsibilities and terms for each role. Leadership roles will be selected at the beginning of Fall/Winter and will be decided upon by current Leadership team. If for any reason, a member of the leadership team can’t handle their responsibilities or is found unfit for their role, a replacement will be found, unless there are 3 months left to the end of their term.   As part of the regular core team meetings, we will conduct check-ins with each member of the Leadership team to confirm their capacity, state of health, etc.
