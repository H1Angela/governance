# Advisory Board MOU

## Background

Hack for LA is a volunteer-run group empowering a diverse array of citizens to improve government, nonprofit, and community services. Hack for LA, which launched its first event in June of 2013 in partnership with Mayor Eric Garcetti and the i.am.angel Foundation, is the official Los Angeles brigade of the civic technology nonprofit, Code for America. Today, Hack for LA hosts weekly Civic Hack Nights, bringing together technologists, public staff, activists, students, and citizens to tackle important regional challenges.

## Purpose

As Hack for LA continues to grow with volunteers and weekly and monthly events, we need to start thinking about the strategic long-term goals needed to create self sufficient organization. In order to build Hack for LA for the future, we recognize that we need to bring together a board of like-minded civic leaders to create a better Hack for LA. We also need guidance and thoughtful perspectives in order to guide Hack for LA’s long-term goals.

As a member on the Hack for LA Advisory Board, you will be fundamental in determining our strategic long-term goals. The Advisory Board will help answer the direction Hack for LA will take that will ultimately shape our goals for the future.

The Hack for LA Advisory Board is made up of a group of talented, experienced civic tech professionals that give us your time, expertise, advocacy, and resources as we continue to grow.
The MoU is not a legally-binding document; the Advisory Board is not a legal board. But, we do want to be respectful of your investment and make a formal promise that reflects that. 

The MoU acts as a shared understanding of how we’ll work together over the next year
