How do you view homelessness? Is it such a massive issue that you get stuck wondering how you can help out and make a positive impact? 

Join us as Hack for LA hosts an afternoon of lightning talks and design thinking workshops as we aim to tackle the homelessness issue in Los Angeles. 

Hear from local thought leaders in government and nonprofits including _____ (name some big names). Then you'll put your mind to work as we shift towards taking action and thoughtfully design solutions to these same issues shared earlier.

Following the conclusion of our event at 7:00PM, our friends at LA-Tech.org will be hosting a Civic Tech Happy Hour nearby. All attendees of this event will receive a free drink ticket to help keep the networking and ideas flowing! 

Stay tuned for further updates!
