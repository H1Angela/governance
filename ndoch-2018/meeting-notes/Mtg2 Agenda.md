# Meeting Notes

## LA Counts
* Main takeaways
	* Data focused projects can be an outcome of our National Day
	* HFLA's goal is to surface the challenges these nonprofits/gov have, helping attendees distill out problems
	* Everyone will have a problem, the speaker will take part, and the takeaway is to form a problem statement with a clear audience
	* At HFLA nights, we usually just take a stab in the dark in terms of WHO the project is serving, so National Day will be an opportunity to do a deep dive into the problems and the people affected.
* If there's something else LA Counts would like out of the event, they should give us direction on how to proceed
	* As far as resulting working groups go, LA Counts needs to send a representative to oversee ongoing projects

## Reviewing Event Schedule
* Push up start time to 2:20PM, allowing 10 mins for a welcome speech
	* Incl. introducing HFLA, thanking sponsors, donations in the back, hopes for event outcome, Lex talks about workshops, introduce keynote speaker
* Opening Remarks to include "talk to our HFLA people about their projects"
* Closing Remarks to include takeaways

## Merch for Donations
* How much are we selling our shirts for?
	* Josh needs to check if CCF
	* We purchased shirts for $7 each
* $5 donations
	* Specific national-day stickers
	* Jim's cookies?
* $15 donation
	* "For a donation of at least $15, you'll be able to go home with a free t-shirt today!"
	* Create a sign for our tshirt table

## Fundraising
* We can give merch in exchange for donations, however there are things to note:
	* Case #1: If the total cost of the merch is $10.90 or above, the customer cannot tax deduct the full donation amount. Instead they can only deduct the amount of "(full donation) - (cost of merch)"
		* Example: if our tshirt costs $20 per unit and a person donates $30 in exchagne for a shirt. The amount the customer is allowed to deduct is $10.
	* Case #2: If the total cost of the merch is under $10.90, the customer can deduct the full donation amount.
	* Case #3: If the full donation amount is > $10k, then things get complicated.
* Hack for LA, under Hackerfund, is allowed to start Facebook fundraising campaigns
	* Everyone should start personal campaigns on facebook for NDoCH
	* Goals of $2-2500
* Need to update Donorbox for NDoCH
