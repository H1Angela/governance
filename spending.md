# Spending

We don't have any fixed costs or variable costs at this point.  We've been able to get swag and meeting spaces sponsored.  Here are some things we *could* raise funds for:

Useful Things

* Sharpies
* Post-it notes
* Giant post-it notes
* Flyer printing (to distribute at other orgs' events)
* Name tag stickers
* Printed displays for project groups to present.

Tech Things

* Domain Names
* Heroku - CFA actually pays for access on a project basis - http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/resources/software

Marketing Things

* Vinyl stickers
* Fitted women's tees
* Custom sticker swag
* Custom t-shirt designs
* Other swag
  * Tote bags
