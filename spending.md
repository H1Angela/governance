We don't have any fixed costs or variable costs at this point.  We've been able to get swag and meeting spaces sponsored.  Here are some things we *could* raise funds for:

Useful Things

* Sharpies
* Post-it notes
* Giant post-it notes
* Flyer printing (to distribute at other orgs' events)
* Name tag stickers

Tech Things

* Domain Names

Marketing Things

* Unique swag in general
