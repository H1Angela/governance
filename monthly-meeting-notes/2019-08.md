## Discussion

### Day of Action

__Thoughts from last meeting:__

- Informational event to learn about expungement, using last year's Homelessness event as a recurring model.
- Present the #heart working prototype as a local success story working on regional issues.  Also works as a follow-up from last year's event.
- Caution about unrealistic expectations to produce something rather than our strength, whcih is in the network we bring and exploring the problem.

__Resources:__

- [Planning Toolkit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1is2VoY4xx0NZWbhXAr7BIMuQj6OcEKDbMIEYTVASOTM/edit?ts=5d3e49d3#)
- Introduction to Bo from [NDICA](http://thendica.org/) as a possible event partner.
- Introduction to Ingrid from [A New Way of Life](http://anewwayoflife.org/) as a possible event partner.
- Reaching out to LA County Public Defender as a possible event partner.

__Needs:__

- Call for hack night volunteers suitable for participating in NDoCH event planning. Might work better as a direct ask.

  * __Update__: We finalized the Mission Statement at the retreat (yay!). The resulting statement is in the doc.

* Brigade Congress is October 18-20 in Cleveland, OH. Consider if you want to attend or propose a session topic.

* Acknowledging/rewarding our volunteers: ideas? want to take the lead?

* We've seen interest in partnerships coming from a student group at UCLA and from a professor at SMC. Due to proximity it seems any relationships would be directly with the Westside hack nights. If anyone has thoughts they'd like to share, DM @joshuazrobins.
